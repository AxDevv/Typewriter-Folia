# 0.9.X API changes

## `ThreadType` Deprecation

Originally, `ThreadType` was used to invoke the coroutine context for different processes in Typewriter.
This is now deprecated in favor of actual coroutines dispatchers and contexts.

### Primary Bukkit Thread
This operates on the Paper main thread and should be used for all Paper API interactions.

```kotlin showLineNumbers
// highlight-red
ThreadType.SYNC.launch {}
// highlight-green
Dispatchers.Sync.launch {}
```

### Async Bukkit Thread
This executes on the asynchronous Paper thread, suitable for tasks without strict timing requirements or those intended for the Paper scheduler.

```kotlin showLineNumbers
// highlight-red
ThreadType.ASYNC.launch {}
// highlight-green
Dispatchers.TickedAsync.launch {}
```

### Async Typewriter Thread Pool
Utilize the Typewriter thread pool for time-sensitive tasks.
As the most asynchronous of the three dispatchers and independent of the paper scheduler, it continues operating even during scheduler lag.

```kotlin showLineNumbers
// highlight-red
ThreadType.DISPATCHERS_ASYNC.launch {}
// highlight-green
Dispatchers.UntickedAsync.launch {}
```

If working in **IntelliJ**, it will automatically suggest the correct replacements.

## `SpeakerEntry` and `EntityInstanceEntry` Changes

The way sound is handled in `SpeakerEntry` and, by extension, `EntityInstanceEntry` has been updated to use variables.


### Introduction of `InteractionContext`

Many updated methods now require a nullable `InteractionContext`. This context is essential for resolving `Var` values, allowing properties like sound or volume to be dynamic based on the current game state.

You can typically obtain the `InteractionContext` in two ways:

1.  **From the `Player` object using the `interactionContext` extension property:**
    ```kotlin showLineNumbers
    val interactionContext: InteractionContext? = player.interactionContext
    ```

2.  **From the execution scope of an entry**, where it is often provided as a `context` property (e.g., in `ActionTrigger`).
    ```kotlin showLineNumbers
    override fun ActionTrigger.execute() {
        // The 'context' property is directly available here
        val dynamicSound = sound.get(player, context)
        player.playSound(dynamicSound, context)
    }
    ```

### Sound Field

The `sound` field now utilizes a `Var<Sound>` type. This change affects how you set and get sound values.

```kotlin showLineNumbers
// highlight-red
class CustomEntityDefinition(
    ...
    override val sound: Sound = Sound.EMPTY,
    ...
) : SimpleEntityDefinition {
// highlight-green
class CustomEntityDefinition(
    ...
    override val sound: Var<Sound> = ConstVar(Sound.EMPTY),
    ...
) : SimpleEntityDefinition {
```

**To get the sound:**
Retrieving the sound now requires the context of a `player` and an optional `interactionContext`.

```kotlin showLineNumbers
// highlight-red
val sound: Sound = entry.sound
// highlight-green
val sound: Sound = entry.sound.get(player, interactionContext)
```

## `Sound` Class Changes

Several fields and methods within the `Sound` class have been updated.

### Volume and Pitch Fields

The `volume` and `pitch` fields have been changed from `Float` to `Var<Float>`.

**To set the volume and pitch:**
When creating a new `Sound` instance, you now need to wrap the `volume` and `pitch` values in a `Var`, such as `ConstVar`.

```kotlin showLineNumbers
// highlight-red
val sound = Sound(DefaultSoundId("minecraft:ambient.cave"), SelfSoundSource, AdventureSound.Source.MASTER, 1.0f, 1.0f)
// highlight-green
val sound = Sound(DefaultSoundId("minecraft:ambient.cave"), SelfSoundSource, AdventureSound.Source.MASTER, ConstVar(1.0f), ConstVar(1.0f))
```

**To get the volume and pitch:**
Accessing the `volume` and `pitch` now requires a `player` and an optional `interactionContext`.

```kotlin showLineNumbers
// highlight-red
val volume: Float = sound.volume
val pitch: Float = sound.pitch
// highlight-green
val volume: Float = sound.volume.get(player, interactionContext)
val pitch: Float = sound.pitch.get(player, interactionContext)
```

### `play` Method

The `play` method's signature has been updated. It now takes a `Player` and a nullable `InteractionContext` instead of an `Audience`.

```kotlin showLineNumbers
// highlight-red
sound.play(audience)
// highlight-green
sound.play(player, interactionContext)
```

The corresponding extension functions have also been updated to reflect this change.

```kotlin showLineNumbers
// highlight-red
fun Audience.playSound(sound: Sound)
fun Audience.stopSound(sound: Sound)
// highlight-green
fun Player.playSound(sound: Sound, context: InteractionContext?)
fun Player.stopSound(sound: Sound)
```
